  description: "I work at the <a target='_blank' href='https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/'>University of Chicago</a>, 
  doing research about exoplanets. 
  To discover new planets across the Galaxy, I love observing all types of stars using a variety of telescopes, 
  both in space (like JWST, TESS or Kepler) 
  and the darkest sites on Earth (Canary Islands, Hawaii or Chile). 
  But my favourites are the cool red stars we call M dwarfs, which are the most numerous in the Milky Way 
  and give us the best chance to study terrestrial
   planets like ours and their atmospheres."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am from Priego de Cordoba, a very beautiful village in the south of Spain. 
    My research focuses on understanding how planets form and what are they made of. 
    In particular, I am very interested in studying the origin and nature of planets between the size
    of Earth and Neptune. Although we have none of them in our Solar System, it appears that the stars
    in our neighbourhood have a lot of them! 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I like to spend my free time with my wife and daughter traveling, 
    going to museums, trying new food or exploring the city. 
    I have many other interests like jazz and flamenco music, architecture, 
    sports, sience outreach and many more. 
    Feel free to ask me!

  description: "I have led or participated in the discovery and characterization of more than 200 planets orbiting all types of stars.
Since the beginning of my PhD in 2018, I have published 120+ papers (18 as first/co-lead author), given 30+ international talks, and awarded more than 550 nights (almost two full years!) of competitive telescope time. 
Additionally, I regularly serve in funding review and telescope time allocation panels, and review numerous publications for astronomy journals."

      They are the most numerous type of planet in our Galaxy, but absent in the solar system.
      My research focuses in deciphering the properties of these planets. 
      What are they made of? Where do they form? 
      And, more interestingly, could they harbor the right conditions for sustaining life?"

      The observatoryis the culmination of more than a decade of work in the rural areas of Andalusia doing hundreds of publicly-open, free astronomical observations, experiment shows and introduction courses in schools, and helping local businesses to use the night sky as a natural resource to attract low-impact, ecological, and socially-responsible tourism."
