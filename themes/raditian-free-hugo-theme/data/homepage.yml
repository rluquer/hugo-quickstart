  description: "I work at the <a target='_blank' href='https://uchicago.edu/'>University of Chicago</a>, 
  doing research about exoplanets. 
  To discover new planets across the Galaxy, I love observing all types of stars using a variety of telescopes, 
  both in space (like JWST, TESS or Kepler) 
  and the darkest sites on Earth (Canary Islands, Hawaii or Chile). 
  But my favourites are the cool red stars we call M dwarfs, which are the most numerous in the Milky Way 
  and give us the best chance to study terrestrial planets like ours and their atmospheres."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am from Priego de Cordoba, a very beautiful village in the south of Spain. 
    My research focuses on understanding how planets form and what are they made of. 
    In particular, I am very interested in studying the origin and nature of planets between the size
    of Earth and Neptune. Although we have none of them in our Solar System, it appears that the stars
    in our neighbourhood have a lot of them (more than any other type of planet). 
    Since we cannot send any satellite to study them in detail 
    (like we do with other bodies in the solar system), 
    we need to rely on our indirect methods to learn all about them.
    My favourite techniques to discover and measure precisely their properties 
    are the radial velocity method 
    and the transit technique (which we can also use to study their atmospheres!).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I like to spend my free time with my wife and daughter traveling, 
    going to museums, trying new food or exploring the city. 
    I have many other interests like jazz and flamenco music, architecture, 
    sports, sience outreach and many more. 
    Feel free to ask me if you want to know more!
